# Epic Loot Heart and Home loot tables

This mod contains only loot table updates for new items from Heart and Home that aren't part of the default 
loot tables, yet.

## Other recommended mods

Here is a list of other mods / mod packs I created and like to use myself for single player (but those could also be
used on servers, if the server admins install them):
* [Single Player Essentials](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/FixItFelix/SinglePlayer_Essentials/)
  -> another mod pack with some features I personally like
* [Single Player Base](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/FixItFelix/SinglePlayer_Base/)
  -> another mod pack with some features I personally like
* [Regenerative Nature](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/FixItFelix/RegenerativeNature/)
  -> using [SpawnThat](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/ASharpPen/Spawn_That/) to respawn natural resources
  like tin and some trees and rare seeds
* [No Skill Drain](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/FixItFelix/NoSkillDrain/) -> on death your gained
  skills aren't lowered
* [Item Configs for CLLC](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/FixItFelix/CreatureLeveLAndLootControl_itemconfig/)
  -> this mod added ItemConfig*.yml files for
  [CLLC](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Smoothbrain/CreatureLevelAndLootControl/) mod
* [Reworked enchants for EpicLoot](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/FixItFelix/EpicLoot_reworked_enchants/)
  -> adds enchanting recipes and available enchants for
  [EpicLoot](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/RandyKnapp/EpicLoot/) mod since the author created a lot enchants
  that don't make too much sense for me and I added some more handy recipes.

## Installation

* Automated: just install as long as using TMM or R2Modman.
* Manual: you need to know what you are doing ;)

Take care, this mod will overwrite the EpicLoot files:
* iteminfo.json
* loottables.json

Can only be used if no other mods overwriting the same files!

## Changelog

* 1.2.1 -> fixed automation config using wrong file name
* 1.2.0 -> using new cool ASP mod to move EpicLoot files, so no manual steps required anymore ;)
* 1.1.0 -> added new items and creatures for game patch version 0.205.5 (added root armor items and abomination 
creature), also added missing creature growth
* 1.0.0 -> first version
