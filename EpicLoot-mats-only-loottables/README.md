# Epic Loot enchanting mats only dropped

This mod contains heavily modified loot tables for [EpicLoot](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/RandyKnapp/EpicLoot/)
mod, so, only enchanting materials will get dropped instead of dropping enchanted items. This change pushes crafting
items more into the centre of the game again, since default EpicLoot will make crafting items irrelevant.

## Other recommended mods

Here is a list of other mods / mod packs I created and like to use myself for single player (but those could also be
used on servers, if the server admins install them):
* [Single Player Essentials](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/FixItFelix/SinglePlayer_Essentials/)
  -> another mod pack with some features I personally like
* [Single Player Base](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/FixItFelix/SinglePlayer_Base/)
  -> another mod pack with some features I personally like
* [Regenerative Nature](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/FixItFelix/RegenerativeNature/)
  -> using [SpawnThat](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/ASharpPen/Spawn_That/) to respawn natural resources
  like tin and some trees and rare seeds
* [No Skill Drain](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/FixItFelix/NoSkillDrain/) -> on death your gained
  skills aren't lowered
* [Item Configs for CLLC](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/FixItFelix/CreatureLeveLAndLootControl_itemconfig/)
  -> this mod added ItemConfig*.yml files for
  [CLLC](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Smoothbrain/CreatureLevelAndLootControl/) mod
* [Reworked enchants for EpicLoot](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/FixItFelix/EpicLoot_reworked_enchants/)
  -> adds enchanting recipes and available enchants for
  [EpicLoot](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/RandyKnapp/EpicLoot/) mod since the author created a lot enchants
  that don't make too much sense for me and I added some more handy recipes.

## Installation

## Installation

* Automated: just install as long as using TMM or R2Modman.

Take care, this mod will overwrite the EpicLoot files:

Can only be used if no other mods overwriting the same files!
