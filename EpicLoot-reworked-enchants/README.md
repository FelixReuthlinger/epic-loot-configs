# Epic Loot Heart and Home loot tables

This mod contains config files for Epic Loot that contain some reworks on enchants and adds some more recipes.

## Installation

### Epic Loot manual steps

To actually make this modpack work properly, you will need to do some manual steps, since Randy still didn't choose to make his loot mod to 
also support custom configs by reading file from config folder. You will need to go to the modpack folder (where TMM did install it into 
the profile) and copy around the custom configs to make them work. Starting the game without this step will load the default configs for 
EpicLoot, which screws up the game a lot, since the loot is way to powerful and the game gets boring by this - imho.

Steps:
1. go to TMM client
2. click "settings" button on the left
3. click "locations" tab on the top of the right selection menu
4. click "browse profile folder" -> a windows explorer should be opened
5. switch to the window of the windows explorer
6. navigate into folders "BepInEx\config\EpicLoot"
7. copy all files inside that folder
8. navigate into folder (again starting from profile folder) "BepInEx\plugins\RandyKnapp-EpicLoot"
9. paste all the files there and accept to overwrite any existing files

(if you wanna help to making this easier, I guess Randy will be happy to get that feedback on discord, maybe he changes his mind some time)
