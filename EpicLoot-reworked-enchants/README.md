# Epic Loot reworked enchants

This mod contains config files for Epic Loot that 
* change the basic list of available enchants (removed some, reworked some to only apply meaningfully, like
  you would only want to have "Recall" ability on spears that are throwable and removes throwable for other
  weapon types).
* adds some new recipes how to combine and up-craft enchanting materials.
* adds some other handy recipes like being able to craft chain item from iron bars.

## Other recommended mods

Here is a list of other mods / mod packs I created and like to use myself for single player (but those could also be
used on servers, if the server admins install them):
* [Single Player Essentials](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/FixItFelix/SinglePlayer_Essentials/)
  -> another mod pack with some features I personally like
* [Single Player Base](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/FixItFelix/SinglePlayer_Base/)
  -> another mod pack with some features I personally like
* [Regenerative Nature](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/FixItFelix/RegenerativeNature/)
  -> using [SpawnThat](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/ASharpPen/Spawn_That/) to respawn natural resources
  like tin and some trees and rare seeds
* [No Skill Drain](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/FixItFelix/NoSkillDrain/) -> on death your gained
  skills aren't lowered
* [Item Configs for CLLC](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/FixItFelix/CreatureLeveLAndLootControl_itemconfig/)
  -> this mod added ItemConfig*.yml files for
  [CLLC](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Smoothbrain/CreatureLevelAndLootControl/) mod
* [Reworked enchants for EpicLoot](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/FixItFelix/EpicLoot_reworked_enchants/)
  -> adds enchanting recipes and available enchants for
  [EpicLoot](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/RandyKnapp/EpicLoot/) mod since the author created a lot enchants
  that don't make too much sense for me and I added some more handy recipes.

## Installation

* Automated: just install as long as using TMM or R2Modman.
* Manual: you need to know what you are doing ;)

Take care, this mod will overwrite the EpicLoot files:
* enchantcosts.json
* magiceffects.json
* recipes.json

Can only be used if no other mods overwriting the same files!

## Changelog

1.1.0 -> using new cool ASP mod to move EpicLoot files, so no manual steps required anymore ;)
1.0.0 -> first version
